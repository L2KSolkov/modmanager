=== What is ModManager===
ModManager is server framework that enables players, admins and developers
to get the most out of BattleField servers.

It enables custom admin modules to be easily developed to enhance the
abilities of the server.

Additional or updated modules are then easily installed and loaded without
even restarting your server, reducing down time and keeping players happy.

=== Getting ModManager ===
Download the latest version of ModManager here: http://www.fileplay.net/search?q=ModManager

=== Installing ModManager===
To install just unzip into your servers directory

=== Running ModManager ===
Their are two ways you run ModManager depending on which package
you have.

Package #1 (Quick)
If you dont have modmanager.py in your bf2/admin directory
no further action is needed.

Package #2 (Safe)
If you have a modmanager.py in your bf2/admin directory
you will need to change your server config to to use it as
the admin script e.g.
sv.adminScript "modmanager"
If you are using the Windows server launcher change
AdminScript to be "modmanager" ( without the quotes )

=== Installing new modules ===
This couldnt be simpler just extract the new module so that
it sits in the "admin/modules" directory, add
modmanager.loadModule "<new module>"
To your modmanager.con and away you go.

=== Enhanced Rcon ===
ModManager includes a much enhanced rcon which can easily be
extended by addition modules. Due to this flexibility different
command will be available depending on which modules you have
loaded. For a full list of available commands you the built in
help system once you are logged into rcon.

==== Included modules ====
1) mm_announcer
Provides "On Join" and Time based messaging
Note: Messages on join are currently to all due
host.sgl_sendTextMessage( playerid, channelid, typeid, text, flags )
being broken for channelid 14 ( Player )

2) mm_autobalance
A direct conversion of the default Auto Balance script
with the addition of tuneables to disable balancing of
squad members, squad leader and the commander

3) mm_bf2cc
Provides the server side method to support BF2CC see
http://www.bf2cc.com for more info on this excellent
Rcon Client.

4) mm_kicker
Provides, ping ( high and low ), idle and bad word based kick and
bans.

5) mm_logger
Provides default file based logging

6) mm_reserver
Provides slot reservation based on player profileids

7) mm_rcon
A major update to the standard RCON including context
sensitive help, a fully extensible framework, enhanced error
detection as well as a number of other fixes.

8) mm_sample
A basic sample module

9) mm_tk_punish
A direct conversion of the default Team Kill script

10) mm_clanmatch *** DEPRICATED ***
Does nothing, please use mm_autobalance instead

11) mm_banmanager
Manages bans maintaining the following information:
* Player Nick
* Player key
* Player IP
* Datetime of ban
* Ban Period
* Ban Type
* Banned By
This is also multi server compatible so bans will no longer be lost
if you are running multiple servers from the same directory.

==== Developing modules ====
Developing modules for ModManager is easy. A good starting point
is contained in the modules/mm_sample directory. In addition to
this the core modules that ship with ModManager will help you
with examples of how almost everything works.

The ModManager API below is the listing of the methods ModManager
provides to enable you to develop BF2 modules quickly and easily.

Extending rcon in modules is simple the module just needs
to register its additional command handlers using
registerRconCmdHandler

==== Notes ====
* If you register handlers you should do so in the init() method
and call the converse method in shutdown()
* Due to the lack of a host.unregisterHandler( method ) modules
which use host.registerHandler( method ) should include a local
state variable which masks the call of these methods if the module
has been shutdown. See mm_announcer for an example of this.
* If your module registers for updates the update() method should
be clean an quick as this method will be called VERY often. Failure
to do so may cause significant performance penalties ( high CPU
load and lag ).
* module rcon commands should be added via the sub command interface
see mm_sample for an example of this
* You are encouraged to use the helper methods in mm_utils to
provide a consistent interface to kick and ban. Using these methods
will ensure your code takes advantage of any enhancements that may
become available in BF2 for this area in the future
e.g. Player dialog messages.
* All modules must provide a class level mm_load method which returns
the module object.
* Modules which support reload ( __supports_reload__ = True ) must
provide an object level shutdown method.
* It is not guaranteed that shutdown will be called on modules when
the server exits.


==== Debugging ====
Debugging support in ModManager is enabled using
 modmanager.debugEnable 1
 modmanager.debugFile "modmanager_debug.log"
 modmanager.logLevel 10
This will create a log file in the servers main directory
which will capture any error / info that is generate by your
module.
